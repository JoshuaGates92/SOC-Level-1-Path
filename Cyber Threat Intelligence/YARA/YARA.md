Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym

Using a Yara rule is simple. Every `yara` command requires two arguments to be valid, these are:  
**1)** The rule file we create  
**2)** Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for.

YARA is created as a pattern-matching/finding tool to detect binary and textual patterns contained within a file, including hexadecimal.
