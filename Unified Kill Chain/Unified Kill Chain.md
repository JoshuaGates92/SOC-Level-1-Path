A cybersecurity defense is also known as ==cybersecurity posture==

A ==kill chain== is the stages of an attack, in our case a cyber attack.

## What is threat modelling?

Fundamnetally, threat modelling is about identifying risks, boiling down to:
1.  Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment. For example, is the system critical to normal operations, and is a system holding sensitive information like payment info or addresses?
2.  Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially exploited
3.  Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted
4.  Putting in policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occurring again where possible (for example, implementing a software development life cycle (SDLC) for an application or training employees on phishing awareness).
